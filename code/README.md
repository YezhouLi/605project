# 605project

Because the dataset is extremely large, we do not upload them to github. The sturcture of whole project folder in our working environment (remote ubuntu) is shown as what follows, 

* `code/someCode`  
* `data/mr_1_loc`  
* `data/raw`  

where `data/raw` contains raw datasets downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rsaxby/merra1). 

`data/mr_1_loc` contains small dataset components splitted by `code/splitByLoc.sh`
